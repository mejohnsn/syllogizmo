SylloGizmo is a logic calculator for finding mood and figure of
a classical Aristotelian syllogism. SylloGizmo also verifies the
validity of the syllogism and shows the mnemonic, e.g. 'Barbara' or 'Ferio' etc.

NB: such a mnemonic exists for all valid syllogisms, and for most valid only with strengthening premise. The mnemonic is shown, of course, only for those syllogism that have one.

If the syllogism requires an additional strengthening (existential)
premise, such as "There exist Spartans", then SylloGizmo will report
that, too.

SylloGizmo is a handy gizmo for anyone learning about syllogisms. It
is especially useful for high-school or college students learning
about syllogism in a logic, debate, philosophy or math class.

A future version will include drawing the Square of Opposition and the Venn diagram illustrating the syllogism.

Known bugs: Japanese localization very incomplete.
